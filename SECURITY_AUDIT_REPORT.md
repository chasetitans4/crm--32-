# Security Audit Report

**Date:** January 30, 2025  
**Scope:** CRM Application Security Review  
**Auditor:** AI Security Assistant  

## Executive Summary

This security audit identified several critical and high-priority security vulnerabilities in the CRM application. The most concerning issues involve API key exposure, weak encryption keys, and insecure environment variable handling.

## Critical Vulnerabilities (Immediate Action Required)

### 1. API Key Exposure in Client-Side Code
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**File:** `src/components/Settings.tsx` (lines 111, 120)  
**Issue:** Production and development API keys are exposed in client-side code using `NEXT_PUBLIC_` environment variables.

```typescript
key: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_PROD_API_KEY || "[REDACTED]",
key: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_DEV_API_KEY || "[REDACTED]",
```

**Risk:** API keys exposed to all users, potential unauthorized access to backend services.  
**Recommendation:** Move API keys to server-side only, use secure key management.

### 2. Hardcoded Test Credentials
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**File:** `cypress/support/commands.ts` (line 12)  
**Issue:** Hardcoded test password in source code.

```typescript
const testPassword = "testPassword123"
```

**Risk:** Credential exposure, potential unauthorized access.  
**Recommendation:** Use environment variables or secure test data management.

### 3. Weak Default Encryption Keys
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Files:** 
- `src/utils/security.ts` (line 265)
- `src/services/emailService.ts` (lines 413, 443)

**Issue:** Weak default encryption keys with predictable values.

```typescript
const legacyKey = "legacy-encryption-key-change-me"
const masterKey = process.env.EMAIL_MASTER_KEY || 'default-master-key-change-in-production'
```

**Risk:** Data encryption can be easily compromised.  
**Recommendation:** Generate strong random keys, enforce key rotation.

## High Priority Issues

### 4. Insecure BoldSign API Key Handling
**Severity:** HIGH  
**File:** `src/services/boldSignService.ts` (line 4)  
**Issue:** API key exposed via `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix.

```typescript
const BOLDSIGN_API_KEY = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_BOLDSIGN_API_KEY || ""
```

**Risk:** Third-party service credentials exposed to clients.  
**Recommendation:** Move to server-side environment variables.

### 5. Mailjet Credentials Exposure
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Files:** Multiple service files  
**Issue:** Email service credentials exposed via `NEXT_PUBLIC_` variables.

```typescript
apiKey: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_MAILJET_API_KEY || "",
secretKey: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_MAILJET_SECRET_KEY || "",
```

**Risk:** Email service compromise, potential spam/phishing attacks.  
**Recommendation:** Server-side credential management.

### 6. Stripe Secret Key in Client Code
**Severity:** HIGH  
**File:** `src/services/stripe.ts` (line 200)  
**Issue:** Stripe secret key accessible in client-side code.

```typescript
const stripe = new StripeService(process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY || "sk_test_mock_key")
```

**Risk:** Payment processing compromise.  
**Recommendation:** Server-side only payment processing.

## Medium Priority Issues

### 7. Weak Encryption Configuration
**Files:** `src/utils/encryption.ts`, `src/services/emailService.ts`  
**Issue:** Encryption enabled only in production, fallback keys exposed.

### 8. Insecure Default URLs
**Files:** Multiple configuration files  
**Issue:** HTTP URLs used as defaults instead of HTTPS.

### 9. Environment Variable Validation
**Issue:** Missing validation for critical environment variables.

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Critical)
1. **Remove all `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefixes** from sensitive credentials
2. **Rotate all exposed API keys** immediately
3. **Generate strong encryption keys** and store securely
4. **Remove hardcoded credentials** from source code

### Short-term Actions (1-2 weeks)
1. Implement server-side API proxy for external services
2. Add environment variable validation
3. Implement secure key management system
4. Add security headers and CSP policies

### Long-term Actions (1-3 months)
1. Implement comprehensive secrets management (HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)
2. Add security monitoring and alerting
3. Implement regular security audits
4. Add penetration testing

## Security Best Practices

### Environment Variables
- Use `NEXT_PUBLIC_` only for non-sensitive configuration
- Validate all required environment variables at startup
- Use different keys for different environments

### API Security
- Implement API rate limiting
- Use JWT tokens with short expiration
- Add request signing for sensitive operations

### Encryption
- Use industry-standard encryption algorithms (AES-256)
- Implement proper key rotation
- Store encryption keys separately from application code

### Monitoring
- Log all security-relevant events
- Monitor for unusual API usage patterns
- Implement alerting for security violations

## Compliance Considerations

This application may need to comply with:
- **GDPR** (if handling EU user data)
- **CCPA** (if handling California resident data)
- **SOX** (if publicly traded company)
- **HIPAA** (if handling health information)

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate:** Fix critical vulnerabilities within 24 hours
2. **Weekly:** Review and implement high-priority fixes
3. **Monthly:** Conduct follow-up security review
4. **Quarterly:** Full penetration testing
