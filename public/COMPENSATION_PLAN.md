**Last Updated:** July 1, 2025

This document outlines the compensation structure for our commission-only sales contractor team, effective immediately. Commissions are calculated monthly and paid a week after the client's invoice is paid, always on a Friday.

## Monthly Commission Structure

| Service Type | Sales (Per Month) | Commission Rate (%) | Notes |
|--------------|-------------------|---------------------|-------|
| All Services | Sales 1-4 (Any Service: Web Design or Local SEO) | 30% | This is the baseline starting commission rate for any service sold in a given month. |
| All Services | Sales 5-9 (Any Service) | 35% | The commission rate for all services increases based on the total number of projects sold within the same month. The maximum commission rate a contractor can earn in any given month is 40%. Each commission percentage increase earned will increase the percentage for all sales (Web Design and Local SEO) for the given month. For example, if a contractor sells (10) contracts (any combination of Web Design or Local SEO), the commission percentage will be 40% for each sale that month. |
| All Services | Sales 10+ (Any Service) | 40% |  |

## Key Details

**Sales Revenue:** Money paid by Pixel Works' clients due to services contracts rendered. Revenue can only be taken into consideration as payments are processed successfully by Pixel Works. Any payment plans will spread potential Revenue out over longer periods of time, and will not be considered Revenue in advance of payment. Only as payments are paid to Pixel Works, will Revenue be considered to calculate earned Sales Commissions.

**Commissions:** The Pay contractors receive based on the % earned from Sales Revenue generated from Sales made only from the services offered by Pixel Works LLC.

**Commission Rate Calculation:** Commission rates for all services (Web Design and Local SEO) range from 30-40% depending on the amount of "Sales" achieved in a month. Commission rate increases (5%) based on the monthly sales volume.

For example:
- Sales 1-4 (Any Service): 30% (Commission)
- Sales 5-9 (Any Service): 35%
- Sales 10+ (Any Service): 40% (up to the cap)

**Commission Rate Reset:** Commissions are calculated on a monthly basis starting on the first day of the month (beginning of day) and final calculations end on the last day of the month (end of day). At the start of each new month (first day), the commission rate for all services resets to the base rate of 30%.

**Payment Terms:** Commissions are paid one week after any portion of the client's invoice for the respective service has been paid to the company. Contractors receive a percentage of the actual amount paid by the client, per payment and always on a Friday. Bonuses are not classified the same as commissions; see Bonus Pay Definition.

**Commission Draws:** Contractors are guaranteed one draw per month against their pending earned commissions. Any requests for additional draws within the same month are subject to management's discretion and approval. All commission draws will be deducted from the contractor's total calculated monthly commission payout.

**Commission Cap:** The maximum commission rate a contractor can earn in any given month is 40%. Each Commission % increase earned will increase the % for all final sales for the given month. Even though the first sale begins at 30%, if a contractor sells (10) contracts, the Commission % will be 40% for each sale that month.

**Definition of a Sale:** A sale is officially defined when the client has signed their contract and made their initial deposit payment.

**Initial Pay Definition:** Commissions paid from a client's initial 50% deposit. The commission rate applied to this payment will be the rate achieved for the month the sale was finalized. If a Deposit needs to be adjusted / reduced to finalize a sale, the commission will be adjusted accordingly.

**Base Pay Definition:** Base Pay refers to commissions paid from a client's remaining 50% balance, post the initial deposit. The amount the contractor receives from this Base Pay is determined by the Commission rate achieved for the month the sale was achieved.

**Lead Time Clarity:** A sale is credited to the month in which the client's initial deposit payment is successfully received by Pixel Works, regardless of when the contract was signed. This determines which month's commission tier applies to that sale.

**Bonus Pay Definition:** Bonus Pay refers to commissions paid for milestones achieved for any monthly, quarterly, or yearly goals or competitions that are set by management / ownership. The % or $ amounts will be specific to each goal or competition created by management / ownership. Bonuses will typically be paid out 1-2 weeks after they're achieved, but no later than 4 weeks after they're achieved, depending on the goal / competition.

**Commission Requirements:** A sale must be finalized as defined, and commissions are only paid one week following a paid invoice. If invoices are not paid, commissions are not paid, regardless of a client's contract or remaining balance owed.

## Compensation Plan Terms & Conditions

If the sales contractor resigns their position or is terminated from Pixel Works LLC, the following terms apply regarding commissions:

**Forfeiture of Pipeline:** Upon resignation or termination, the contractor immediately forfeits any unpaid contracts / unsold leads. Pixel Works LLC reserves the right to re-distribute Leads to other contractors, in order to sell products & services to these leads. Only the contractor that makes a "Sale" as defined in this Compensation Plan will earn Commissions from the sale.

**Commissions Post-Termination (All Services):** For all sales (Web Design and Local SEO) finalized (contract signed and initial deposit made) prior to the contractor's final day, any commissions owed from client invoice payments (initial deposit and/or remaining balance) made after the contractor's final day will still be paid out. These commissions will be paid one week after the client's invoice is paid, provided the payment is processed successfully.

**General Commission Payment Rules:** Commissions are strictly paid only after clients pay as outlined in this Compensation Plan. Regardless of any sales made, Commissions will only be paid to contractors if and when a contracted client makes a payment. Any unearned revenue paid by clients (i.e., from sales not finalized before the contractor's final day) will not be converted to commissions to be paid to the terminated contractor.

**Conduct and Voided Commissions:** Sales must be earned honestly and legally. If contractors act outside of the scope of Pixel Works' Sales Process, Pixel Works reserves the right to void commissions earned from a particular sale, or terminate the contractor's contract with our company.

**Final Payout:** Once a contractor's contract is terminated with Pixel Works LLC, the sales contractor forfeits all future commissions or payouts beyond the specific post-termination commissions defined above. Final payment calculations for terminated contractors will be notified of their final payment in a timely fashion. Commission and Bonus payouts are defined in these compensation plan terms.
